A. student.name  
B. student['Grad Year']  
C. student.greeting()  
D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name  
E. student.courseLoad[0]

A. the ouput is 32  since '3' is a string so 2 is considered as string as well thus it is going to concatenate them.  
B. the output is 1. '3' is considered as integer becasue there is no subtraction in string  
C. the output is 3. The value for null is 0.  
D. the out is 3null Since '3'  is string so we have string concatenation.  
E. the output is 4. Since the value for true is 1.  
F. the output is 0. Since the value for both of them is 0.  
G. the output is 3undefined. Undefined is considered as string again string concatenation.  
H. the output is NaN. undefined has no value so no integer subtraction.

A. true. Because '2' converts to an integer and 2>1 is true.  
B. false. we have string comparison. and the index of 2 is greater than index of 12.  
C. true. because '2' will be converted to integer.  
D. false. because '===' is a strict equality operator so they must be the same typed.  
E. false. because value for true is 1.
F. true. because boolean(2) is 1 and true is also 1 so 1===1 is true.  

15.  '==' Returns true if the operands are equal.it ignores the datatype of the variable however '===' Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type.
